# stuf

```
- [stu]ward [f]inance
- [stuf]f
```

a finance tool

## the idea

- most finances are "bottom up"
- miss one transaction, u sort of f-ed up
- this is designed to be "top down"
- at a minimal level, even just entering ur monthly bank balance should give u some sort of analysis
- and then from the missing information, the app should implicitly guide u to answer more questions about ur own finances, hence u will only look for answers that matter
- the hope is that, even filling in maybe 40-70% of information, is enough to give u enough knowledge and control about ur finances, ur cash flow
- that also alleviates the pressure of keeping up-to-date and perfect records
- ideally this also incorporates great queries, note taking, and zero-based envelop budgeting
- essentially combining Google Sheets / Excel Spreadsheets together with Actual Budget / YNAB, with the power of SQL queries

answers that `stuf` should be able to answer:
- how many months until i can save up till x amount?
- how much can be saved per month?
- how much can i invest per month, while saving money, without going broke, while still be able to travel?
- how much money can i use now at the supermarkey?
- can i afford this thing?
- net growth or loss last month / last few months / last year? why?
- how much money do i need to allocate monthly for x? (yearly expense, saving goals, investments, emergency fund)
- what is my current strategy / action plan for my finances?

things that `stuf` should be able to support
- multi-currency
- multi-person (can be separate profiles, can be together in one profile, can be "hybrid")
- zero-based / envelop budgeting
  - being one month ahead (or more)
- tagging
- queries
- aggregation (sum, count)
- notes
- reports (cash flow / category trend)
- exporting (prevent lock-in)

stretch goals of `stuf`
- track investments and their performance
- debts (student loans)

outcomes of using `stuf`
- can answer any of the questions above on a daily basis (almost immediate basis)

## the app

- will develop as a TUI first, for my personal use, and to quickly verify that the workflow works
- also as a TUI, forced to think of things in an efficient way, vim-style keyboard shortcuts
- open to making it a web app as well in the future

## the tech stack

- golang, bubbletea, sqlite, goose, sqlc

## user journey

- TODO

## TUI mockupHa!
